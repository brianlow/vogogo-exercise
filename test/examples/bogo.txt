# The app doesn't natively support pricing schemese such as:
#    "buy one get one free", or 
#    "buy one get one half off" 
# However these can be simulated with the set pricing scheme. 
# For example:
#   "buy one get one half off" for $0.50 apples 
# can be expressed as:
#   "buy a set of 2 for $0.75"
#
- {scheme: 'set',  item: 'Apple', size: 2, price: 0.75 }
- {scheme: 'unit', item: 'Apple', price: 0.50}
